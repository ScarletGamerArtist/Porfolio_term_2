This program uses three different classes. With the quizCardBuilder, you can create flash cards that each 
contain a question and an answer to that question. The window that the program runs in also has a file 
menu, so you can save, load, and get a new card. 
Once you save the cards that you have made in the quizCardBuilder, you can open them up in the 
QuizCardPlayer. Here you can see the cards and the answers to the cards using a "Show Answer" button.
